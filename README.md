# Python DSA Basics Repository

This repository contains Python implementations of basic data structures and algorithms, including **Linked List**, **Stack**, and **Postfix Expression Evaluation**.

## Files Included

### 1. **linkedlist.py**
   - Implements a basic **Linked List** data structure.
   - A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (node) points to the next one. It supports efficient insertions and deletions at the beginning and middle of the list.
   - Functions typically include adding nodes, deleting nodes, and displaying the list.

### 2. **postfix.py**
   - Implements **Postfix Expression Evaluation**.
   - **Postfix notation** (Reverse Polish Notation) is a mathematical notation where operators follow their operands. This file evaluates postfix expressions using a stack.

### 3. **stack.py**
   - Implements a basic **Stack** data structure.
   - A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations are `push` (to add an element) and `pop` (to remove an element).
